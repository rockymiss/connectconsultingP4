# Connect Consulting

For my **Portfolio 4 Project** on the **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)** course I have created a Blog Website for a consulting Company called Connect Consulting.  

Connecting Consulting is a Consulting Company that can help clients identify their business issues, develop solutions and take remedial action.  Itâ€™s main objective is to create a meaningful impact in the lives of their clients.  What sets Connect Consulting apart is their genuine passion for helping others.  Connect Consulting connect the dots of business through people.

The website is created almost like a Wordpress Blog website where the user can create, view, edit and delete blogs on the frontend making it easier on the client and it saves on yearly subscription fees.

Link to the deployed app is [here](https://connect-consultingp4.herokuapp.com/).

## Version Control


### Git and GitHub 

Local repository and IDE used: GitPod
Remote repository used: GitHub

Steps followed: 
- I created a new public repository on GitHub using the Code Institute template.
- I then created a workspace and started coding on GitPod. 
- All relevant files were created. 
- To save my work safely I continued to use the terminal consistently by using: 
    - **git add .** to add work to git
    - **git commit -m""** to commit the work 
    - **git push** to update work to GitHub 


### Deployment to Heroku

The website was deployed to heroku by doing the following: 

1. Navigate to [heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login). 

2. Click "new" and create a new App. 

  <details open>
  <summary>New App</summary>
  <p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1649974679/rugby/new-app-heroku_vteenf.png"></p>
  </details>
  <br>

3. Give your app a name, choose your region and Click "Create app". 

  <details open>
  <summary>Name and Create</summary>
  <br>
  <p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1649974679/rugby/name-app-heroku_ein4ms.png"></p>

  </details>

4. The menus that we are concerned with are "Deploy" and "Settings".  Click on "Settings" First. 

  <details open>
  <summary>Settings</summary>
  <br>
  <p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1649974678/rugby/deploy-settings-heroku_zjvoxb.png"></p>

  </details>

5. Copy the contents of the creds.json file.  Insert "CREDS" into the key field and the entire contents of the file into the value field.  The template code provided will use this information to create the file called creds.json and write this data into it as the application is built.

  <p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1649978071/rugby/creds-heroku_fbc93f.png"></p>
  </details>

6. Buildpacks now need to be added.  These install future dependancies that we need outside of the requirements file.   The first is python and the second is node.js.  Select Python first and then node.js and click save.  Make sure they are in this order.

  <p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1649974678/rugby/buildpacks-heroku_k4r9nm.png"></p>
  </details>

7. Then go to the deploy section and choose your deployment method.  To connect with github select github and confirm. 

  <details open>
  <summary>Connect to github</summary>

  <p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1649974679/rugby/github-heroku_jcxvgc.png"></p>
  </details>

8. Search for your repo, select it and click connect.

  </details>

9. You can choose to either deploy using automatic deploys which means heroku will rebuild the app everytime you push your changes.  For this option choose the branch to deploy and click enable automatic deploys.  This can be changed at a later date to manual.  Manual deployment deploys the current state of a branch.
